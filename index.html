            <p class="lb-text">Loid Forger aka agent "Twilight" had served as a spy for at least ten years after 
                serving in the Westalian military for a few years. His current mission moves him to Ostania where 
                he creates the alias "Loid Forger," and starts the Forger Family, becoming the adoptive father of 
                Anya and entering a fake marriage with Yor Briar. Loid can be considered a jack of all 
                trades: he is extremely physically and mentally skilled, has a razor-sharp mind and intellect, and 
                is able to adapt to nearly any situation, only ever surpassed combat-wise by stronger individuals 
                like Yor or matched by other agents of similar caliber. His skillset includes proficiency in 
                hand-to-hand combat, marksmanship, and mastery in disguises. </p>

            <p class="lb-text">Yor Forger works as an ordinary office clerk at Berlint City Hall, while also 
                leading a secret life as a Garden assassin under the code name "Thorn Princess". Needing a cover 
                to continue her job as an assassin, Yor enters a fake marriage with Loid Forger with the intention 
                of fulfilling both of their respective goals and subsequently becomes the adoptive mother of his 
                daughter, Anya. Despite her slim frame, Yor possesses monstrously superhuman physical abilities. 
                Her punches and kicks are strong enough to generate mild but noticeable air currents.</p>

            <h3 class="lb-heading">Anya Forger - formerly known as : Test Subject 007</h3>
            <p class="lb-text">She is the adopted daughter of Loid and Yor Forger. She attends Eden Academy as 
                a first-year student in Cecile Hall. Anya, formerly known as Test Subject 007 is also a 
                telepath whose abilities were created in an experiment conducted by an unknown organization.
                Anya is capable of reading the minds of other people and animals; her ability depicted as small 
                sparks around her head. Due to her telepathy skills, unbeknownst to her adoptive parents, she 
                knows what both of her parents real jobs are, despite their efforts to hide it from her.</p>

            <h3 class="lb-heading">Bond Forger - formerly known as : Subject 8</h3>
            <p class="lb-text">Bond is the pet dog of the Forger Family. Formerly known as Subject 8, Bond was 
                used as a test subject in the Ostanian research project known as Project Apple, which resulted 
                in him gaining precognitive abilities. Bond's time as a research experiment left him with 
                precognitive abilities and above-average intelligence for a dog. He is capable of understanding 
                human speech. Bond gained precognitive abilities from the experiments done to him, allowing him 
                to briefly see sometimes fragmented scenes from a few minutes to a few hours into the future.</p>
